// PLAN

1. Break down design into sections
2. "npm create vite@latest . -- --template react"
3. create single component to test
4. Build the component tree - App, header, form, flashcards - flashcard, footer etc
5. hard code flashcard data in app component
6. Form needs to update the top level state that holds list of cards
7. where does data live? App
8. each flashcard needs own state to track open/closed status
9. form needs to use setter state function to add cards to list
10.
